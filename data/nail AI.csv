notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at zoom out the model is confused between nails, riverts, defect, long screw",,,,,,,,,,,,,
issues with FP and FN: defects are incorrectly identified (nails -> defect and vice-versa),,,,,,,,,,,,,
objects should be positioned horizontally to assist model inference,,,,,,,,,,,,,
objects keep rolling and confuses the model during inference,,,,,,,,,,,,,
