## üéØ **Research Impact**

This study fundamentally challenges the widespread assumption that AI assistance universally improves human performance. Through **280 controlled experimental trials** across seven object categories, we provide empirical evidence that **context determines everything** in human-AI collaboration.

### **The Research Question That Changes Everything**
> *"Does AI assistance always improve human performance in object detection tasks?"*

**Our Answer**: **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** The relationship is complex, context-dependent, and often counterintuitive.

## üî• **Research Findings**

### **üèÜ The Accuracy Paradox**
**Humans significantly outperformed AI-assisted systems in 5 out of 7 object categories:**

| Object Category | Human Accuracy | AI-Assisted | Performance Gap | Statistical Power |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Tek-screws** | 99% | 85% | **+14 points** | p < 0.001, d = 3.53 |
| **Black screws** | 103% | 86% | **+17 points** | p < 0.001, d = 2.34 |
| **Rivets** | 100% | 83% | **+17 points** | p < 0.001, d = 4.25 |
| **Long screws** | 100% | 91% | **+9 points** | p < 0.001, d = 3.08 |
| **Washers** | 100% | 97% | **+3 points** | p < 0.001, d = 3.49 |

**Exception**: Only nails showed the expected AI advantage (89% vs 44% human accuracy)

### **‚ö° The Speed Paradox**
**AI assistance was faster in only 4 out of 7 cases:**

- **Best AI Performance**: Washers (46% faster), Nuts (45% faster)
- **Worst AI Performance**: Black screws (31% slower), Nails (51% slower)
- **The Trade-off**: Speed gains often came at the cost of accuracy

### **üîç The Quality Control Crisis**
**Humans demonstrated systematic superiority in defect detection:**

- **Tek-screws**: Humans detected 128% more defects (14.6 vs 6.4)
- **Rivets**: Humans detected 128% more defects (9.8 vs 4.3)
- **Critical Finding**: AI systems missed 30-60% of actual defects in complex objects

## üìä **Experimental Design & Data**

### **Rigorous Methodology**
- **280 total experimental trials** (20 rounds √ó 7 objects √ó 2 systems)
- **Controlled laboratory conditions** with standardized procedures
- **Three performance dimensions**: Accuracy, Speed, Defect Detection
- **Statistical validation**: Independent t-tests, Cohen's d effect sizes

### **Object Categories by Complexity**
- **Simple**: Washers, Nuts (geometric, uniform)
